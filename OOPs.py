#1. Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.
#2. Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message saying the engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.
#3. Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
# Deposit an amount.
# Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
# Print the account balance.
#4. Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books. Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# Add a book to the library.
# Remove a book from the library.
# Check if a book is available by title.
# Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
# Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).

#Accessing instance attributes and methods.
